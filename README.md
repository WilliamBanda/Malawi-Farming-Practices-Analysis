# Comparative Analysis of Deep Bed Farming vs Conventional Ridging in Malawi

## Project Overview
This repository contains data and an analysis script from a quasi-experimental study comparing **Deep Bed Farming (DBF)** and **Conventional Ridging (CR)** systems in Malawian smallholder maize farms. Conducted in partnership with Tiyeni Organization, the research demonstrates DBF's potential to increase yields by 70% while improving soil health metrics.

## Repository Contents
- `/data`: Cleaned datasets (CSV format) containing:
  - Plant population counts
  - Biomass measurements
  - Grain yield records
  - Soil quality indicators
- `/analysis`: R scripts for:
  - Statistical comparison (DBF vs CR)
  - Yield correlation analysis
  - Visualization scripts for key metrics

## Key Findings
- **70% yield increase**: DBF plots produced 8.5-9.0 Mt ha⁻¹ vs CR's 5.0 Mt ha⁻¹ [P ≤ 0.005]
- Enhanced soil structure with 33% higher moisture retention in DBF systems
- 28.6% greater plant establishment rates in DBF (450 vs 350 plants/10m²)
- Complete biomass analysis showing 50% higher stalk production in DBF

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:

## Data Collection
Field data collected by [Tiyeni Organization](https://www.tiyeni.org/) through:
- Standardized plot measurements
- Harvest weight records
- Soil sampling at 0-30cm depth

## Acknowledgments
This research was made possible by smallholder farmers participating in the study and Tiyeni's field staff. Please cite this work if using any materials.
